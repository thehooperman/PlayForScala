# 8.5 Authenticating JSON web service requests

Sample application from chapter 8 of [Play for Scala](http://bit.ly/playscala).

This sample shows how to implement HTTP basic authentication in a controller that serves JSON data to a single-page JavaScript application.

When you run the application, you are prompted for a user name and password using HTTP basic authentication. Enter any user name and password: the sample just logs what you enter, and does not check these credentials in any way.
